# yt-shorts-autonext

Just paste the content of main.js into the console when on the youtube shorts page and it will autoplay.

Or you can save the content of min.js as the URL for a bookmark, and then just click the bookmark when you're on yt shorts.

Feel free to do anything with this. If you make an actual chrome extension please let me know!
